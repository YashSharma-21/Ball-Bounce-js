# Ball Bouncing Game (HTML, CSS and Javascript)
<p>
  This game is based on the famous ball bouncing ball called DX-Ball, although it does not contain any blocks to destroy, it offers other basic features such as <br>
  allowing a player to make a block collide with a bouncing ball. This game also offers a auto assist mode which can be turned ON or OFF by setting a boolean variable (currently called as "autoHandle").<br>
  The auto assisting code has been written in such a way that the block only auto adjusts when the ball is moving in its direction and is a little bit close to it.
